# Compatible DC Power Supplies for the Lonely Roads powered bus board system
The ideal power requirement of the board is +-15v DC

Theoretically the 78MXXS regulators have an input range between 14–35v DC. However this would require ideal conditions with appropriate heatsinking. Every volt supplied over 14v will disapate in heat. In practise the regulators are internally limited by the maximum operating temperature of the regualators (125°C) so depending on the size of the heatsink mileage varies. To keep the heat to a minimum keeping the voltage as close to 14v as possible is recommended. 15v beeing the ideal voltage.

To allow for a range of DC and AC solutions to powering this system, below a range of +-15v DC power supplies.

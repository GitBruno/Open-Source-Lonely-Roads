# Power Sandwitch
An add-on for the Open Source Lonely Roads power distribution boards. This add-on makes the OSLR boards eat a wide variety of power supplies. 

So besides any +- 15v cage power supply the OSLR can be powered off:

- Single 9-18v DC supply
- Dual 15+v DC supplies (E.g. 2 laptop chargers)
- Single 9-18v or 18-36v supply (Cheap!)

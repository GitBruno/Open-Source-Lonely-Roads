GOALS:
Ultra low noise
Ultra low inter module noise
Protection + safty features
3u boat compatible (not wider or taller then a 3u base)
Wide range of voltage inputs solutions
Good heat handaling/disiapation
low price
readily avalible parts
A range of PCB manufaturing options (design not totaly resticted by super thick pcb or anykind of special treatment)

TODO:

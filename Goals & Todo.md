# GOALS
- Ultra low noise
- Ultra low inter module noise
- Protection + safty features
- 3u boat compatible (not taller then 3u)
- Standard 84hp (19") and 104hp compatible (not wider then 50hp)
- Wide range of voltage inputs solutions
- Good heat handling/dissipation
- Good price
- Good documentation
- readily avalible parts
- A range of PCB manufaturing options (design not totaly resticted by super thick pcb or any kind of special treatment)

# TODO
- Solve power input question
- Re arrange pcb design for better spacing
- Test prototype in system

# DONE
-first prototype built and tested

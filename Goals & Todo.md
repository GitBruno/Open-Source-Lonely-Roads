# PROS
- Ultra low noise
- Ultra low inter-module noise
- Protection + safety features
- 3u boat compatible (not taller then 3u)
- Standard 84hp (19") and 104hp compatible (not wider then 50hp)
- Wide range of voltage input solutions
- Good heat handling/dissipation
- Good price
- Good documentation
- readily avalible parts
- A range of PCB manufaturing options (design not totaly resticted by super thick pcb or any kind of special treatment)

# CONS
-This system uses more power in standby then a passive system  
-This system is less efficient then a passive system (duh)  

# TODO
- Solve power input question  
- Re arrange pcb design for better spacing  
- Make space for heatsinks  
- Solve magic smoke from negative input cap (16v may not be high enough on the caps, should have gone 30v+)  
- Put diodes after fuses to stop flooding on a critical fail  
- Test prototype in system  

# DONE
- first prototype built and tested  
- fix error in v4 diode protection

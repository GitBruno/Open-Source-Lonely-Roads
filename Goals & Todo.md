# GOALS
- Ultra low noise
- Ultra low inter module noise
- Protection + safty features
- 3u boat compatible (not taller then 3u)
- Standard 84hp (19") and 104hp compatible (not wider then 50hp)
- Wide range of voltage inputs solutions
- Good heat handling/dissipation
- Good price
- Good documentation
- readily avalible parts
- A range of PCB manufaturing options (design not totaly resticted by super thick pcb or any kind of special treatment)

# TODO
- Solve power input question
- Re arrange pcb design for better spacing
- solve magic smoake from negitive input cap (16v may not be high enough on the caps, should have gone 30v+)
- Test prototype in system
- put diodes after fuses to stop flooding on a critical fail

# DONE
-first prototype built and tested
- fix error in v4 diode protection

# CONS
-the system uses more power in standby then a passive system
-the system is less efficient then a passive system (duh)
